# What is Blazor Battles?

Blazor battles is a persistent web based game built in .NET with C# code, and of course a Blazor front end, where it gets it's name from.

In this game, users earn currency (Bananas) to spend on building armies to battle each other with.
Real users fight to climb the leaderboard and build the strongest army. The user with the most victories will be the top rank!

Revive your army's health by spending bananas on your fallen army. Rinse and repeat battling with other armies, and strengthening your own, this sums up the core game loop.
